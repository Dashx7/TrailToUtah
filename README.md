# TrailToUtah
Welcome to the Trail to Utah, or the The LDS Trail West. I felt like the Trail to Utah bit have been a little bit missleading, but thought it sounded funnier than the alternative. Either way it contains a game where you get to experience the life of an early saint in my small little world that I made based upon real life examples. This was a small project I made when first learning java.

If you realize that you can change/delete my project I kindly ask that you don't (Don't worry past self I fixed it). Anyways, I hope that you enjoy it half as much as I liked making it.
